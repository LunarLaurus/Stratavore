## Security Features Implemented

From the code review recommendations:

- COMPLETE Transactional outbox pattern (zero message loss)
- COMPLETE Advisory locks for quota enforcement (no race conditions)
- COMPLETE Publisher confirms for RabbitMQ (guaranteed delivery)
- COMPLETE Heartbeat TTL with reconciliation (stale runner detection)
- COMPLETE Prepared statement support (SQL injection prevention)
- COMPLETE Context-based timeouts (prevents hanging)
- COMPLETE Structured logging with trace IDs (observability)
- COMPLETE HMAC signature fields for audit integrity
- COMPLETE Agent token table for authentication
- COMPLETE Graceful shutdown with timeout

## Architecture Highlights

### Transactional Outbox
```go
func CreateRunnerTx(ctx context.Context, req *LaunchRequest) (*Runner, error) {
    tx.Begin()
    // 1. Acquire advisory lock (prevents races)
    // 2. Check quota
    // 3. Insert runner
    // 4. Insert outbox event
    tx.Commit()
}
```

### Concurrent Outbox Processing
```sql
SELECT * FROM outbox 
WHERE delivered = false 
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED; -- Multiple publishers can run!
```

### Heartbeat with TTL
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION reconcile_stale_runners(ttl_seconds INTEGER)
-- Marks runners as failed if last_heartbeat too old
```

## What Remains To Be Implemented

   - Sync with PostgreSQL
   - Offline capability

4. **Session Management**
   - Session creation/tracking
   - Resume logic
   - Transcript storage (S3/local)

5. **Metrics Exposition**
   - Prometheus HTTP handler
   - Metric definitions
   - Label management

6. **Notifications (ntfy)**
   - Client implementation
   - Event-to-notification mapping

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)

1. **Remote Runners**
   - Multi-node support
   - Remote process monitoring
   - Network overhead handling

2. **Session Embeddings** (Qdrant)
   - Vector similarity search
